# SelectiveRepeat
This project is geared towards simulating the transport layer protocol of the network stack. Selective-Repeat mechanism will be used to
ensure reliable data transfer.
The following assumptions are made:

1. Half duplex communication between sender and receiver
2. Packets can be corrupted and lost
3. Packets arrive in order
